      <p>
        Let me tell you the story about our heroes. Argo was constructed by the
        shipwright Argus, and its crew were specially protected by the goddess
        Hera. ... According to a variety of sources of the legend, Argo was said
        to have been planned or constructed with the help of Athena. According
        to certain sources, Argo was the first ship to sail the seas.
